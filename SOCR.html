	    <h4> April 2, 2018 </h4>	
	
			<p>When the original Shadow of the Colossus came out in 2005, I did not play it despite having a PS2. I was too busy 	    	blasting away at goons in Ratchet and Clank and pickpocketing keys in Sly Cooper to notice it. In this way, I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to experience it for the first time. I went in with no expectations, wondering what a 13 year old game could possibly do to deserve all the hype. </p>

<p>I was a fool.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Colossus is astounding. Unlike most games today, it’s mechanically sound and actually demands dexterity and skill to play. Each encounter is so well-built and unique, even with ~20 years of experience playing games I felt challenged and intrigued every time I faced a new Colossus.</p>

<p>These things are secondary however, to the way the game impacts a player’s emotions and thoughts. In this way, Shadow of the Colossus is haunting. The game breaks a player down in ways that I never thought a game could, or would. In the era of super saturated, lighting-fast, instant gratification Online multiplayer games, Shadow of the Colossus denies that dopamine hit every few seconds we’ve all come to expect. In God of war, for example, you scale and slay a towering boss and are typically rewarded with new weapons, tons of XP, and a bad ass cutscene. In Shadow of the Colossus, however, you fight tooth and nail to slay a beast, watch it fall to the ground, watch the light fade from its eyes, and the world is dead silent. In this moment, a player gets a chance to reflect and ask questions like: “What have I done?”.</p>

<p>This is what makes Shadow of the Colossus generationally great. Like a great film or a great book, it makes you feel. The Last of Us is great because it made us feel crushing sadness, genuine terror, and welling hope. Last year, Horizon Zero Dawn was great because it made us feel so enthralled at a beautiful world, so curious about its characters, and so desperate in our effort to save both and find answers. Chads, Brads, and Thads dropping hours into Fortnite and COD:WWII do not and will not understand this because those games do not make a player feel anything besides rage after they get killed for the 12th time in a 60 second span.</p>

<p>Old people, in their close-mindedness, will fight to the death to prevent video games from being considered to fall under the definition of art. Shadow of the Colossus, however, is probably the best case for games to be considered art. Just go play it.</p>
