	       <strong> Why Titanfall 2 is the FPS you should be playing 2 years later... </strong>
            </span>

    <h4> April 13, 2018 </h4>

    <p>Since the release of the original 1993 DOOM, the First-Person Shooter genre has become
      a ubiquitous element of popular video games. Yearly entries in multiple series of First-Person
      Shooters by AAA MegaDevelopers are outright expected in the modern market of games.
      Players by the millions grind for hours each day in these shooters’ online modes, seeking
      everything from scoreboard glory to a coveted weapon or item. Considering the recent, explosive
      popularity of Battle Royale style online shooters, as well as the enduring presence of the FPS
      genre as a whole, one could have difficulty trying to find the best overall experience in a
      supersaturated market of often mediocre games. However, one needs only to look back to
      October 28, 2016 and the release of Respawn Entertainment’s Titanfall 2 to find all the elements
      of a great shooter and more. Titanfall 2, even two years later, is still arguably the most unique,
      well polished, challenging, and fun FPS available to all platforms and FPS enthusiasts. While
      similar to most modern first person shooters, Titanfall 2 sets itself apart by directly addressing
      and solving many problems that bring down otherwise good shooter games. Not only does
      Titanfall 2 solve problems, it builds on already strong elements such as movement mechanics,
      level design, and both PVE and PVP play. Simply, Titanfall 2 is the shooter that delivers the best
      experience for new and veteran shooter fans alike, and it is the best overall choice for shooter
      fans, even two years later. </p>

    <p>Today, most FPS games are heavily multiplayer focused. Games such as Blizzard’s
      Overwatch (2016) and, in fact, the original Titanfall (2014) are played exclusively online with
      and/or against other players. Many consumers who focus solely on multiplayer often skip FPS
      games’ single player campaigns entirely, possibly contributing to the often less-than- stellar state
      of some recent popular shooter campaigns. After the lackluster, or outright lack of, a single
      player campaign in the original Titanfall, Respawn Entertainment responded to this criticism by
      adding a notably well-crafted single player campaign (by shooter standards) to Titanfall 2.
      Throughout the campaign, a player is given the opportunity to try and experiment with all Pilot
      and Titan weapons and loadouts, as well as fight against all types of Titans, thus preparing them
      for online play and allowing them to settle into a play style that works for them. While deep
      moral conflicts and revelations may be absent from the narrative of Titanfall 2’s campaign,
      watching the main character be thrust into action with his new Titan, and forming a fraternal
      bond with the machine over the course of the campaign is surprisingly charming. Notable also is
      the quality and originality of level design in Titanfall 2’s campaign. Sequences spanning vast
      canyons with bottomless chasms, navigating the constantly moving platforms of a massive
      industrial facility, and jumping from present to past and back again in time to cross gaps are all
      memorable instances that push a player and the game’s wall running movement mechanics to
      their limits in Titanfall 2’s stellar single player campaign.</p>

    <p>As with most conventional, popular FPS games today, online multiplayer is a principle
      component of the overall experience. Players will likely spend far more time in this game mode
      than in any offline single-player campaign. Ttianfall 2 is no exception, offering a multiplayer
      mode that far surpasses any of its competitors, both recent and past. The Titanfall experience was
      built on multiplayer, the first game being played exclusively online in a multiplayer setting.
      However, Titanfall 2’s multiplayer not only expands upon the successes of the previous iteration,
      improving the experience, but it improves upon the online FPS experience overall, mitigating or
      solving many of the problems or quirks that arise in traditional online shooters. By design,
      Titanfall discourages camping and other static, trap-like tactics that can frustrate other players
      and devalue the experience. Players are simply too fast, and too well-equipped to counter such
      tactics, that their use puts a practitioner at a disadvantage in such an environment as Titanfall 2’s.
      The expansion of customization and player choice is expanded well in Ttianfall 2, after fans of
      the first game expressed that there were too few customization options present. The abundance
      of different ability and weapon options for Pilots as well as a more than doubled roster of Titans
      diverse in their kits, opens a new world of choices in an already stellar environment for players
      to discover and develop new play styles that fit their desires. The Titans themselves are as joyous
      and tactful to use as they are unique, a contrast to passive or uninvolved kill streak rewards in
      other shooters. Titanfall 2’s online multiplayer is ultimately the highest and most polished
      evolution of any multiplayer game of its type, delivering blistering speed, strategic gameplay
      options, outstanding level design, and hours of intense fun for players seeking an online
      experience.</p>

    <p>Creating and sustaining games in the modern market has become a huge task for even the
      largest of AAA developers. The need for servers and maintenance of those servers, as well as the
      intervention of developers when a certain game mechanic is broken or unfavorable to all players
      is common especially in massively popular online shooter games. Developers must also preform
      an increasingly difficult balancing act when it comes to pleasing their fans, creating a good
      game, and monetizing said game to be profitable. Titanfall 2’s developer, Respawn
      Entertainment, juggles all these responsibilities exceptionally well due in part to lessons learned
      with the first Titanfall but also the past experiences of the core development team, most of whom
      were developers for the studio Infinity Ward working on the massively popular FPS Call of
      Duty: Modern Warfare series. Using this past experience in creating quality FPS games,
      Respawn created the first Titanfall, which was met with criticism for being too barebones,
      having too few customization options, and lacking in a dedicated single player campaign.
      Respawn then did something much bigger developers often have difficulty doing: they listened
      to the feedback and criticism and resolved to improve, then they actually followed through on
      this. In their second effort, Respawn created a respectable single-player campaign, a fleshed-out
      and improved multiplayer mode with many customization options, and even went so far as to
      rework and improve the matchmaking system after it was shown to be lacking post-launch.
      While these steps are unquestionably commendable, and are more than other developers would
      do to deliver a better experience, the concern of how the game would be monetized is an
      increasingly valid concern among game enthusiasts. Predatory business practices by large
      developers including progression-stunting mechanics to encourage (or force) the purchase of
      microtransactions/ RNG (Random Number Generator) loot boxes are becoming alarmingly
      common in popular online games. However, Respawn Entertainment has taken steps to ensure
      that no invasive microtranscations taint the online experience of Titanfall 2, promising that allnon-cosmetic
      post-launch content will be free to all players. So far, Respwan has kept this promise, delivering consistent,
      if a bit sparse, free content and updates throughout the post-
      launch life of Titanfall 2. When criticized by players early on for not being transparent enough
      with their free content update plans, Respawn agains took steps to cultivate goodwill and trust
      from their player base by releasing a month-to- month roadmap of all the free content updates for
      Titanfall 2. Though there are microtransactions present in Titanfall 2, the content to which they
      are tied is purely cosmetic, and does not effect gameplay in any way. This is likely the most
      ethical way to include microtransactions in a game like this, as one can simply ignore them
      completely if they do not wish to buy them, and enjoy the game to its fullest potential while
      doing so. If one is, however, interested in purchasing these microtranscations, they feature no
      alternate currency or RNG of any kind. See a skin pack you like? Simply buy it, no need to
      gamble and hope that one receives the item they desire. All things considered, Respawn
      Entertainment stands as a beacon in an increasingly darkening or apathetic industry, showing that
      it is possible to make a good game, include monetization without alienating players, and properly
      support said game today, even doing so as a studio a fraction of the size of AAA developers that
      cannot do these same things.</p>

    <p>In the hyper-competitive game market of the modern era, with games of nearly endless
      variety originating from all corners of the world, it is rare to find any single game that checks all
      the boxes of goodness. Innovation, accessibility, replay value, proper support, and fun factor all
      rarely come in one package today. Ttianfall 2, however, is one such package. It is a complete,
      modern shooter that satisfies and even improves upon all that which a dedicated shooter fan
      could ask for. A stellar campaign that is enjoyable for new players or shooter veterans that
      prepares one for PVP, an outstanding multiplayer mode that truly innovates and remedies the
      problems of typical online multiplayer shooters, and a dedicated, friendly, talented development
      studio that actually listens and puts players over profits are all reasons why Titanfall 2 is the
      shooter that you should be playing two years later.</p>
